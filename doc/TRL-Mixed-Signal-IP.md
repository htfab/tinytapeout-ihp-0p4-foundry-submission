# Mixed-Signal IP Quality Assessment using TRL scale

The provided set of the quality assessment criteria, using TRL (Technology Readiness Level) scale, is a tool for designers to auto evaluate a submitted design. The purpose of this tool is to
have a short overview of IP in terms of its maturity.

**Self-assessed TRL level: 5**
